# Swapping-System
You are a data analyst for a logistics company that provides a supply chain management platform.
The platform allows companies to manage their inventory, track shipments, and optimize logistics
operations. The platform collects and processes a large amount of data from various sources, such as
sensors, GPS, and weather reports. The company is experiencing a rapid growth in the number of
clients and data volume, which has put a strain on the memory usage and performance of the
platform. The company is looking for a solution to optimize the memory usage and performance of
the platform.

Tasks:
* Implement a swapping system that swaps out unused pages from memory to disk, and swaps
in pages that are needed for processing.
* Develop a data generator that simulates the data volume and diversity of the platform, and
the usage patterns of the clients.
* Evaluate the performance of the swapping system by measuring the memory usage, page
fault rate, and processing time of the platform under different data loads and swapping
policies
